# What is it about ?
We're ending the Hills portion of our training, and before we start learning about the back-end, we were given 4 challenges to re-enforce our front-end skills.  

## Challenge 1 - The Landing Page
A webpage that display the time and date of the day, horizontally and vertically centered, with a nice random background image. You can add useful productivity links for your daily tasks, any useful feature is more than welcome.
